      Add-ons empower millions of Firefox users to personalize their browser's form and function.
      Why not show off your Web smarts by creating an add-on of your own?
      We've developed a wide range of tools to get you going and help you with everything from
      building right through publishing your add-on and sharing it with the world.

      The Add-on Builder is an online build environment that gives you access to the Add-on SDK.
      It offers a robust code editor with a toolset of built-in revisioning, module selection,
      testing and build tools.  It also lets you share your add-on selectively or upload it to
      addons.mozilla.org.

      The Add-on SDK is downloadable and lets you create add-ons using open Web technologies
      in your own development environment through a command line interface.
      If you're a code junkie who prefers to work with your computer rather than online,
      this is for you.
