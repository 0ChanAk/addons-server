# :C0111: *Missing docstring*
#   This is far too noisy, ideally we should ignore it in specific places
#   but pylint isn't very good at letting us specify certain rules for certain
#   files
# :C0103: *Invalid name "%s" (should match %s)*
#   This is rather annoying in some contexts.
# :W0403: *Relative import %r, should be %r*
#   We don't know where zamboni is going to be running, so relative imports
#   are necessary for now.
# :W0142: *Used * or ** magic*
#     This isn't harry potter... there's no such thing as magic.
# :W0232: *Class has no __init__ method*
# :R0904: *Too many public methods (%s/%s)*
# :R0903: *Too few public methods (%s/%s)*
# :E1101: *%s %r has no %r member*
#     This is too often wrong to be useful.
# :R0901: *Too many ancestors (%s/%s)*
#     We end up breaking this with django.
# :R0201: Method could be a function
#     Useful, but there's a number of places where we use methods
#     since we're extending Django classes that require specific
#     methods.
