<h3 id="section-whatis">What are featured add-ons?</h3>

<p>Featured add-ons are top-quality add-ons highlighted in our <a href="{{ link_gallery }}">gallery</a>, Firefox's Add-ons Manager, <a href="http://www.rockyourfirefox.com">Rock Your Firefox</a>, and across other Mozilla websites. These add-ons showcase the power of Firefox customization and are useful to a wide audience of consumers.</p>

<h3 id="section-inclusion">How can my add-on become featured?</h3>

<p>Featured add-ons must be high quality, safe, trustworthy, fast, useful, have wide appeal, and provide a great user experience. These factors are all taken into account when reviewing an add-on to be featured. (see <a href="http://blog.fligtar.com/2010/07/02/making-add-ons-people-will-love/">Making Add-ons People Will Love</a> for tips on best practices)</p>

<p>Featured add-ons should have excellent user reviews and prompt responses from the developer for any concerns or support issues. Additionally, add-ons should have gained some level of popularity on their own merit, usually with a minimum of 15,000 active daily users.</p>

<p>If your add-on meets the criteria above and is hosted in our gallery, please email <a href="mailto:amo-featured@mozilla.org">amo-featured@mozilla.org</a> with:</p>
<ul>
    <li>details on your add-on, including its URL</li>
    <li>an explanation of why your add-on has wide appeal and should be featured</li>
    <li>links to any external reviews of your add-on</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="section-rotation">Featured Add-on Rotation</h4>

<p>Mozilla regularly evaluates and rotates featured add-ons. Some of the most common reasons for add-ons being removed from the featured list are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Lack of growth &mdash; Add-ons that are featured typically experience a substantial gain in both downloads and active users. If an add-on is not demonstrating growth in any substantial way, that's a good indicator that the add-on may not be that useful to our users.</li>
    <li>Negative reviews &mdash; Featured add-ons should have a great experience and very few bugs, so add-ons with many negative reviews may be reconsidered.</li>

    <li>Incompatibility with upcoming Firefox versions &mdash; Featured add-ons are expected to be compatible with upcoming releases of Firefox by the release candidate stage. Add-ons not yet compatible with the release candidates of a major version of Firefox will lose their featured status.</li>
</ul>
