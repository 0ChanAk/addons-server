As users of the web and social media ourselves, we have evolved the idea of Yoono over time in order to meet the growing need for a way to simplify the way you interact with the many popular web services out there today.  \r\n\r\nWe created the current version of Yoono because we wanted to provide users a simple way to unify their social networks and other services like instant messaging and allow them to access these services at any time from anywhere they are on the web.  Having all your friend updates in a real time stream and being able to interact with your friends and all your networks at once as you browse the web is, we believe, an amazing experience and something we hope you will enjoy as well.
