  <h2>What Are Apps?</h2>
  <p>Create rich HTML5 app experiences that run across multiple devices and form factors  (desktop, mobile, tablet, etc.) using Web standards and open
  technologies such as HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. Combine this with a rich distributed ecosystem of HTML5 app stores, including a marketplace operated by
  Mozilla.</p>

  <p>Mozilla aims to put  the developer back in control of every aspect of the app experience â€”  from easy development to distribution to direct customer relationship  management.</p>
