  Featured add-ons are top-quality add-ons highlighted in our <a href="{{ link_gallery }}">gallery</a>, Firefox's Add-ons Manager, <a href="http://www.rockyourfirefox.com">Rock Your Firefox</a>, and across other Mozilla websites. These add-ons showcase the power of Firefox customization and are useful to a wide audience of consumers.

  <h3 id="section-inclusion">{{ _('How can my add-on become featured?') }}</h3>

  <p>
  {% trans %}
  Featured add-ons must be high quality, safe, trustworthy, fast, useful, have wide appeal, and provide a great user experience. These factors are all taken into account when reviewing an add-on to be featured. (see <a href="http://blog.fligtar.com/2010/07/02/making-add-ons-people-will-love/">Making Add-ons People Will Love</a> for tips on best practices)
  {% endtrans %}
  </p>

  <p>
  {% trans %}
  Featured add-ons should have excellent user reviews and prompt responses from the developer for any concerns or support issues. Additionally, add-ons should have gained some level of popularity on their own merit, usually with a minimum of 15,000 active daily users.

  If your add-on meets the criteria above and is hosted in our gallery, please email <a href="mailto:amo-featured@mozilla.org">amo-featured@mozilla.org</a> with:

    <li>{{ _('details on your add-on, including its URL') }}</li>
    <li>{{ _('an explanation of why your add-on has wide appeal and should be featured') }}</li>

  <p>
  {% trans %}
  Mozilla regularly evaluates and rotates featured add-ons. Some of the most common reasons for add-ons being removed from the featured list are:
  {% endtrans %}
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
    {% trans %}
    Lack of growth &mdash; Add-ons that are featured typically experience a substantial gain in both downloads and active users. If an add-on is not demonstrating growth in any substantial way, that's a good indicator that the add-on may not be that useful to our users.
    {% endtrans %}
    </li>
    <li>
    {% trans %}
    Negative reviews &mdash; Featured add-ons should have a great experience and very few bugs, so add-ons with many negative reviews may be reconsidered.
    {% endtrans %}
    </li>
    <li>
    {% trans %}
    Incompatibility with upcoming Firefox versions &mdash; Featured add-ons are expected to be compatible with upcoming releases of Firefox by the release candidate stage. Add-ons not yet compatible with the release candidates of a major version of Firefox will lose their featured status.
    {% endtrans %}
    </li>
  </ul>
