{% block description %}
  An alert popup dialog is a small window which demands user's input related
  to the current activity. It disables all current activities and only
  disappears after the user confirms an action or dismisses the dialog.
{% endblock %}

{% block use_it %}
  When the current activity absolutely requires user input, usually validation (i.e.
  delete all contacts?) or authorization (i.e. enable GPS?).
{% endblock %}

{% block tips %}
  <h2>Do's</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>action oriented (i.e. delete all contacts?)</li>
    <li>do not use an extra title unless the action has severe consequences (ex:
      delete all contacts?)</li>
    <li>short questions or statements</li>
    <li>as a rule of thumb, place the positive button on the right, and the
      negative button on the left</li>
    <li>use descriptive, free standing labels such as &quot;Connect&quot;</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Dont's</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>don't use negation in your question or statement</li>
    <li>don't use it when the action is trivial and reversible. Use a toast
      instead.</li>
    <li>don't use it when you want the user to make a trivial choices.
      Consider a select list instead.</li>
  </ul>
