        <div class="content"><p>Mozilla wants to figure out the best way to keep our users safe if they choose to use third-party software such as plugins. Participating in this study will help us find out!</p>
<h2 id="what-will-happen-next">What will happen next</h2>
<p><strong>If you agree</strong> to participate:</p>
<ol>
<li>We may add security and plugin control features to Firefox to help with online security and performance.</li>
<li>Continue using Firefox as you normally would. Depending on how you use the Web, you may not notice any changes.</li>
<li>After a few weeks, the study will end on its own. Your Firefox will go back to normal.</li>
<li>We will ask you to fill out a quick optional survey to tell us about your experience. The survey should take less than 5 minutes to complete.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="leaving-the-study">Leaving the study</h2>
<p>The study will expire on its own in a few weeks. You may leave the study early. To do so, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Type about:addons into the location bar, and press enter.</li>
<li>Find Plugin Safety in the addons list.</li>
<li>Click the remove button.</li>
<li>If you opt out of the study early we will ask you to fill out a survey. We’re interested in hearing about your experience, even if you didn’t participate in the entire study.</li>
</ol>
<p>Opting out of a study does not prevent you from participating in future studies.</p>

<h3 id="all-shield-studies">All Shield Studies</h3>
<p>Every Shield Study collects data about important study events, such as install, uninstall, daily usage, and end of study. Studies also include an optional survey.</p>
<p>This data is associated with <a href="https://gecko.readthedocs.io/en/latest/toolkit/components/telemetry/telemetry/index.html">Firefox Telemetry collection</a>.</p>
<h3 id="this-particular-study">This particular Study</h3>
<p>In addition to the data collected by all Shield Studies, Mozilla will collect information about: </p>
<ul>
<li>Websites you visit that try to use plugins, and what content on the site requires the plugin;</li>
<li>How you interact with plugin content on those sites, including whether and how you choose to allow the plugin to run.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mozilla will keep this information private; any data will only be shared in aggregate or anonymized form.</p>
<p>You can learn more about the data collection for this study <a href="https://github.com/squarewave/shield-study-essential-flash/blob/master/docs/metrics.md">on GitHub</a>.</p>
