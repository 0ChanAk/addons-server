        <div class="content"><p>Mozilla wants to know if the Activity Stream interface for about:newtab on Desktop Firefox has higher user engagement than the existing Tiles about:newtab UI. Participating in this study will help us find out!</p>
<h2 id="what-will-happen-next">What will happen next</h2>
<p><strong>If you agree</strong> to participate:</p>
<ol>
<li>We will add additional features to Firefox that may provide a new <strong>Activity Stream</strong> experience on the Firefox about:newtab page.</li>
<li>Continue using Firefox as you normally would. You may notice changes.</li>
<li>After 14 days, the study will end on its own. Your Firefox will go back to normal.</li>
<li>We will ask you to fill out a quick <strong>optional survey</strong> to tell us about your experience. The survey should take less than 5 minutes to complete.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="leaving-the-study">Leaving the study</h2>
<p>The study will expire on its own in 14 days.  You may leave the study early.  To do so, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Type <code>about:addons</code> into the location bar, and press enter.</li>
<li>Find <code>Activity Stream Shield Study</code> in the <strong>extensions</strong> list pane.</li>

<li>If you opt out of the study early we will ask you to fill out a survey. We’re interested in hearing about your experience, even if you didn’t participate in the entire study.</li>

<h3 id="all-shield-studies">All Shield Studies</h3>
<p>Every Shield Study collects data about important study events, such as install, uninstall, daily usage, and end of study. Studies also include an optional survey.</p>
<p>This data is associated with <a href="https://gecko.readthedocs.io/en/latest/toolkit/components/telemetry/telemetry/index.html">Firefox Telemetry collection</a>.</p>
<h3 id="this-particular-study">This Particular Study</h3>
<p>In addition to the data collected by all Shield Studies and your voluntary answers to the followup survey, here are the <strong>key things you should know</strong> about what is happening when you participate in this study:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <em>Session</em> ping will be sent to Mozilla servers when you leave the about:newtab.</li>
<li>An <em>Event</em> ping will be sent to Mozilla servers when you interact with the about:newtab page (Top Sites, Highlights, Search).</li>
<li>A <em>Performance</em> ping will be sent to Mozilla servers occasionally to help track responsiveness and latency.</li>
<li>As you would expect, we do not collect any information when you are in private browsing mode.</li>
</ul>
