Dear add-on author,

Good news! Our automated tests did not detect any compatibility issues with your add-on {{ADDON_NAME}} and {{APPLICATION}} {{VERSION}}. We've updated your add-on's compatibility to work with {{APPLICATION}} {{VERSION}} so that our Aurora users can begin using your add-on.

You can view the results of our compatibility check here: {{RESULT_LINKS}}

This compatibility bump is server-side and we did not modify your add-on package in any way.

Though we did not detect any issues, we strongly encourage you to test your add-on in {{APPLICATION}} {{VERSION}} and review the list of changes here: https://developer.mozilla.org/firefox_for_developers

Thank you,
{{APPLICATION}} Add-ons team
