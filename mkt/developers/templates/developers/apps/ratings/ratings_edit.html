      To have your app listed on the Marketplace, you must attain an
      International Age Rating Coalition (IARC) certificate. Clicking on
      the button below will open a new window where you can fill out a
      short yes-or-no questionnaire about the contents of your app. Upon
      completion, the window will close and your app will then have an age
      rating.
