Dear App Developer,

We've added a new payments region to the Firefox Marketplace. The Marketplace will soon be accepting payments for {{ region }}.

If you would like your app, {{ app }}, to be available in that region you will need to visit the Firefox Marketplace Developer Hub and update your app settings on the "Compatibility & Payments" page: {{ payments_url }}

Thanks,
Firefox Marketplace Team
